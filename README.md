# Discord RPC

This is a library for interfacing your game with a locally running Discord desktop client. It's known to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can use the lib directly if you like, or use it as a guide to writing your own if it doesn't suit your game as is. PRs/feedback welcome if you have an improvement everyone might want, or can describe how this doesn't meet your needs.

Included here are some quick demos that implement the very minimal subset to show current status, and
have callbacks for where a more complete game would do more things (joining, spectating, etc).

## Documentation

The most up to date documentation for Rich Presence can always be found in our [developer site](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to)!

## Basic Usage

Zeroith, you should be set up to build things because you are a game developer, right?

First, head on over to the [Discord developers site](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and make yourself an app. Keep track of `Client ID` -- you'll need it here to pass to the init function.

### From package

Download a release package for your platform(s) -- they have subdirs with various prebuilt options, select the one you need add `/include` to your compile includes, `/lib` to your linker paths, and link with `discord-rpc`. For the dynamically linked builds, you'll need to ship the associated file along with your game.

### From repo

There's a [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) file that should be able to generate the lib for you; Sometimes I use it like this:
```sh
    cd <path to discord-rpc>
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to install discord-rpc to>
    cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```
There is a wrapper build script `build.py` that runs `cmake` with a few different options.

Usually, I run `build.py` to get things started, then use the generated project files as I work on things.

There are some CMake options you might care about:

| flag | default | does |
|------|---------|------|
| `ENABLE_IO_THREAD` | `ON` | When enabled, we start up a thread to do io processing, if disabled you should call `Discord_UpdateConnection` yourself.
| `USE_STATIC_CRT` | `OFF` | (Windows) Enable to statically link the CRT, avoiding requiring users install the redistributable package. (The prebuilt binaries enable this option)
| [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.7/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html) | `OFF` | Build library as a DLL

## Continuous Builds

Why do we have three of these? Three times the fun!

## Sample: send-presence

This is a text adventure "game" that inits/deinits the connection to Discord, and sends a presence update on each command.

## Sample: button-clicker

This is a sample [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) project that wraps a DLL version of the library, and sends presence updates when you click on a button.

## Sample: unrealstatus

This is a sample [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com) project that wraps the DLL version of the library with an Unreal plugin, exposes a blueprint class for interacting with it, and uses that to make a very simple UI.
